# Multiple-Object-Tracker
The project idea is to detect people and suspicious objects in a given video and track the person that has that object and also raise an alert which can help the authorities to take the necessary action.Also one other use case of our system is that it can help you monitor online exams by detecting mobile phones if someone tries to use it and also we can keep track of them through their webcams.

The system can also be modified as per need to help you with any of your use cases related to object detection and tracking such as you can train yolo on custom dataset to detect any kind of objects which you need for projects.For example train yolo on images of people wearing masks and you can then easily have a system to check whether a person is wearing a mask or not.

We have used theAIGuysCode yolov3 repository for setting the tracking and we have added a application which will help you to run the tracker very easily.
